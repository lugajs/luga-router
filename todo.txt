DOCS:

- Start

-------------

ROUTER:

- Support route execution priority or rely on order of inclusion?
  Sort routes alphanumerically to define priority?

- By default routes are locked. Global .setUp() or add() config may alter this

- Expose event notification (luga.Notifier)

- Allows arbitrary payload to be passed by a route
- Retrieve state object (if any, created by pushState) to be passed by a route
- Parameters data to be passed by a route
- Tokenized path to be passed by a route (nice to have)

- Router.start()
- Router.stop()
- Router.add(path, callbacks, config)
- Router.remove()
- Router.execute()
- Router.clear() -> remove all routes
- Router.setUp() -> set merge strategy


- route definitions and matching syntax
  Should we use Express's syntax? http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
  Or more Crossroad? https://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/#crossroads-add_route
- Path can be only string or RegExp too?
