	<strong>Heads up!</strong>
	<p>
		Unlike other libraries, luga.router doesn't enforce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton pattern</a>,
		you are allowed to have multiple instances of a router running at the same time.
		This means that, potentially, more than one router may react to the same url/fragment.
	</p>
	<p>
		We consider this a very powerful feature that allow plenty of extra flexibility, especially if you work on the back-end.
		Yet it require extra care because it gives you additional ways to hurt yourself.
