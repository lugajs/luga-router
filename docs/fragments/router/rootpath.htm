	<div class="panel-body">

		<p>
			Whenever you use <a href="#in-action/hash">hash fragments</a> is quite easy to control your fragments;
			if you decided to use <a href="#in-action/pushstate">pushState</a> instead, the router checks location.pathname and try to resolve it
		</p>

		<p>
			The place where your application is deployed affects location.pathname. If your app lives inside the server root like: <br>
			http://localhost/myapp/ => location.pathname = "/myapp/"
		</p>

		<p>
			If instead the application lives deeper inside the server hierarchy, things change:  <br>
			http://localhost/root/sub-root/myapp/ => location.pathname = "/root/sub-root/myapp/"
		</p>

		<p>
			We can deal with this scenario by setting a rootPath:
		</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const myRouter = new luga.router.Router({
	pushState: true,
	rootPath: "/root/sub-root/myapp/"
});
</code></pre>

		<p>
			Once a rootPath is set, the router will "substract" it from the current location.pathname and propery resolve the appropiated route
