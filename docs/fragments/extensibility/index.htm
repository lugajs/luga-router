			Luga Router was written with extensibility in mind.
			The common, essential features are available out of the box, for anything else, you can extend and
			customize.
		</p>

		<p>
			The most notable extensibility feature is that you can write <a href="#extensibility/iroutehandler">your own
			routeHandler implementation</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			If you plan to do so, you can benefit from what <a href="#extensibility/utils">luga.router.utils</a> offers
