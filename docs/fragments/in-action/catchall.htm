		<p>
			Very often you want to have a special kind of rule, one that get executed in case every other rule fail.
			This is easily done in Luga Router:
		</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var myRouter = new luga.router.Router();
myRouter.add(":catchall:", function(){
	console.log("Catch-all route");
});
myRouter.start();
// Programmatically test the router
location.hash = "whatever"; // => log "Catch-all route" inside the console
</code></pre>

			<strong>Heads up!</strong>
			<p>
				Routes are executed from top to bottom and, unless you are using a <a href="#router/greedy">greedy router</a>,
				only the first matching route is executed. This means that the most specific routes must be added first,
				and the catch-all route as the very last one
