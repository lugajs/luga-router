<h2>Luga Router</h2>

<p>A feature-rich JavaScript library for client-side routing. It's compact, focused and sharp.</p>
<p>While developing Luga Router we had a few goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Do not accept a regular expression as path
	</li>
	<li>
		The router is not a singleton, you may run multiple instances of it
	</li>
	<li>
		Make everything extensible and open to customization
	</li>
</ul>
