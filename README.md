## Luga Router

A feature-rich JavaScript library for client-side routing. It's compact, focused and sharp

While developing Luga Router we had a few goals in mind:
- Do not accept a regular expression as path
- The router is not a singleton, you may run multiple instances of it
- Make everything extensible and open to customization

Luga Router is part of [Luga JS](http://lugajs.org/) a set of JavaScript libraries, designed to build form and data centric applications
